# Reference project for hypothetical GIS web classroom course

## Goals

* [ ] Display OSM and custom WMTS map layers on OpenLayers map
* [ ] Import GeoJSON layer from public source and display regional boundaries
* [ ] Interact with vector objects on the map
* [ ] Display "resources" dots from separate source on map (wfs layers)
* [ ] Add "incident" dots on map through UI (e.g. "delivery order")
* [ ] Interact with "incidents"
* [ ] Add "point-of-interest" per "incident" (e.g. "pickup", e.g. "drop-off")
* [ ] Show and hide layers on demand

## Advanced features

* [ ] Use web sockets and offline storage to interact with "resources", "incidents" and "points-of-interest"
* [ ] Use offline storage to cache WMTS layers
* [ ] Multiple projections (one per WMTS layer)
